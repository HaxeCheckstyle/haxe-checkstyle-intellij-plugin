[![experimental](http://hughsk.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](https://github.com/HaxeCheckstyle/haxe-checkstyle-intellij-plugin)

### Known Issues:

On mac, if you can't run it in intelliJ try the following command in Terminal Window run again.

`sudo chmod 755 .idea/run`

Make sure you run the above command in the project root directory.

You could also try the above command in the intelliJ plugins directory which will work for all projects:

`sudo chmod 755 /Users/xxx.xxx/Library/Application Support/IntelliJIdea15/haxe-checkstyle/classes/run`

Make sure you use the correct path to the plugins directory of intelliJ.
